I've realized that I often don't keep track of things that happen and it means 
I don't appreciate them enough. I'd say that's why I created this website, 
but the main reason was originally because I like associating myself with cool and
original website designs lol.
<br><br>
To describe myself further, my name is Ashton P and if I ever come to visit you, I'll
be flattered by a meal of either spaghetti bolgnese, carbonara, any type of pasta really.
<br><br>
My favourite games of all time are the LittleBigPlanet series (especially LBP2) and I got
hold of a PlayStation 3 just to play them (along with other games I managed to get hold of
thanks to my very cool friends). I really enjoy playing the LBP games with friends on LAN.
<br><br>
My top 3 music genres are DnB <i>(Pendulum, Rabbit Junk, KNOWER),</i> Breakcore <i>
(Goreshit, Machine Girl(?), Frums)</i> and any other electronic type
beat.

As per request of Ewan, who is currently sitting next to me as I write this, I will 
append the following string to this page: "<i><b>balls</b></i>"
